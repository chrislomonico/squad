# Squad Documentation

Public-facing documentation for Squad. GitHub Pages ready.

This directory contains only documentation intended for Squad users — guides, sample prompts, API docs, and assets. No internal team content belongs here.

> **Internal team docs** (proposals, sprint plans, postmortems, blog drafts) live in [`team-docs/`](../team-docs/).

## Contents
