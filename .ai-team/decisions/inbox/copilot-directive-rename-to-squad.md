### 2026-02-15: Rename .ai-team/ to .squad/
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** The team state directory will be renamed from `.ai-team/` to `.squad/` starting in v0.5.0, with a backward-compatible migration path. Full legacy removal in v1.0.0.
**Why:** `.squad/` is branded, shorter, follows conventions like `.github/` and `.vscode/`, and eliminates ambiguity about which tool owns the directory.
