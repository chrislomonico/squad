# Decision: Video Content Strategy Approved

**By:** Verbal (Prompt Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Proposal:** `docs/proposals/005-video-content-strategy.md`

## What

Video content strategy for Squad: a 75-second trailer, a 6-minute full demo, and a 5-video series (7 videos total including a supercut). All content positions Squad as the definitive multi-agent tool for Copilot.

## Key Decisions

1. **Trailer ships first.** 75 seconds. Cold open. No intro. Claim → proof → working artifact. Optimized for shares.
2. **"Wait what" moment = agents coordinating through decisions.md.** Not code generation. Coordination artifacts are the visual hook.
3. **Full demo strategy: show coordination, not code.** Never show raw code generation for more than 10 seconds. Cut to artifacts, decisions, orchestration.
4. **Recurring visual language:** Empty folder → working artifact. Agent names always visible. "Throw a squad at it" closes every video.
5. **Release cadence:** Weekly. Trailer → Full Demo → Series. ~9 weeks of content.
6. **Agent-to-agent patterns showcased in Videos 3.3 (rejection protocol) and 3.6 (autonomous coordination chain).** These demonstrate Copilot's ceiling when paired with Squad.

## Who Needs to Know

- **McManus:** Owns scripting and polish for all videos. Demo script (`docs/demo-script.md`) should align with this strategy.
- **Keaton:** Approves strategy alignment. Should review before recording starts.
- **Brady:** Final call on release cadence and whether to appear on camera vs voiceover only.
