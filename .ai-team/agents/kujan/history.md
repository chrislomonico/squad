# Project Context

- **Owner:** bradygaster (bradygaster@users.noreply.github.com)
- **Project:** Squad — AI agent teams that grow with your code. Democratizing multi-agent development on GitHub Copilot. Mission: beat the industry to what customers need next.
- **Stack:** Node.js, GitHub Copilot CLI, multi-agent orchestration
- **Created:** 2026-02-07

## Core Context

_Summarized from initial platform assessment and deep onboarding (2026-02-07). Full entries in `history-archive.md`._

- **Squad is already Copilot-native** — task tool spawning, filesystem memory, background mode all align with the platform. No fundamental rewrites needed. Stay independent (not a Copilot SDK product) but be best-in-class on Copilot.
- **Filesystem-backed memory is the killer differentiator** — git-cloneable, human-readable, and the reliable channel (vs. unreliable response text). Never abandon for SDK abstractions.
- **Inline charter pattern is correct for batch spawns** — coordinator inlines charters to eliminate agent tool calls. For single spawns, agent-reads-own is acceptable.
- **Platform constraints**: 128K token context window, `task` tool with `mode: "background"` is the correct spawn pattern, `explore` sub-agent for semantic search, no agent persistence between sessions.
- **Coordinator size (32KB+) is a maintenance concern** — instruction-following degrades with prompt length. Subsystem extraction or information density optimization needed.
- **Drop-box pattern is the best lock-free concurrent write pattern** on this platform. Preserve and extend.
- **Key validated patterns**: parallel fan-out by default, eager execution philosophy, Scribe serial spawning (confirmed as friction to fix).

- **2026-02-08: P0 Silent Success Bug — Diagnosis and Mitigation (Proposal 015)** — **Context:** Brady flagged that ~40% of background agents report "did not produce a response" when they actually completed all work. Files written, hi
- **2026-02-09: Proposal 012 Revision — Agent Skills Open Standard + MCP Integration** — **Context:** Brady clarified that "skills" means Claude-and-Copilot-compliant skills adhering to the Agent Skills Open Standard (agentskills.io). Also
- **2026-02-09: Platform Timeout Best Practices Documented** — **Context:** Brady discovered that the `read_agent` default timeout of 30s was causing the platform to abandon agents mid-work — reporting "no respons
- **2026-02-09: Proposal 015 Mitigation Verification Audit** — **Context:** Brady requested all agents verify their mitigations are in place for the P0 silent success bug. As the author of Proposal 015, verified a
- **2026-02-09: decisions.md Cleanup — Heading Levels and Line Endings** — **Context:** Audit flagged formatting issues in decisions.md. Tasked with surgical fixes: phantom proposal references, heading level corrections, and 
- **2026-02-09: Platform Feasibility — Direct Messaging Interface (Proposal 017)** — **Context:** Brady wants to work with his Squad via direct messages (Telegram) when away from the terminal. Requested Dev Tunnels over ngrok. This is 
- **2026-02-09: Human Input Latency and Persistence — Platform Analysis** — **Context:** Brady described two pain points: (1) latency when typing while agents work — messages queue and the experience feels unresponsive, (2) hu
- **2026-02-09: VS Code Parity, Mid-Flight Human Input, and Feedback Optimization** — **Context:** Brady asked three platform questions: (1) does Squad work in VS Code, (2) can human input reach running agents, (3) how to optimize feedb
- **2026-02-09: Directive Capture in Coordinator Prompt (Sprint Task 1.6)** — **Context:** Brady requested human directive capture — when users state preferences, rules, or scope decisions, the coordinator should persist them to
- **2026-02-09: Incoming Queue Platform Assessment** — **Context:** Brady asked whether Copilot's built-in TODO capability could serve as an "incoming queue" for user messages — capturing requests while ag

## Recent Updates

📌 Team update (2026-02-09): No npm publish — GitHub-only distribution. Kobayashi hired as Git & Release Engineer. Release plan (021) filed. Sprint plan 019a amended: item 1.8 cancelled, items 1.11-1.13 added.
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): CI pipeline created — GitHub Actions runs tests on push/PR to main/dev. PRs now have automated quality gate. — decided by Hockney
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Coordinator must acknowledge user requests with brief text before spawning agents. Single agent gets a sentence; multi-agent gets a launch table. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Silent success mitigation strengthened in all spawn templates — 6-line RESPONSE ORDER block + filesystem-based detection. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Incoming queue architecture direction — SQL as hot working layer, filesystem as durable store, team backlog as key feature, agents can clone across worktrees — decided by Brady
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): .ai-team/ must NEVER be tracked in git on main. Three-layer protection: .gitignore, package.json files allowlist, .npmignore. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Incoming queue architecture finalized — SQL hot layer + filesystem durable store, team backlog as third memory channel, agent cloning ready. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): If ask_user returns < 10 characters, treat as ambiguous and re-confirm — platform may fabricate default responses from blank input. — decided by Brady
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): PR #2 integrated — GitHub Issues Mode, PRD Mode, Human Team Members added to coordinator with review fixes (gh CLI detection, post-setup questions, worktree guidance). — decided by Fenster
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Documentation structure formalized — docs/ is user-facing only, team-docs/ for internal, .ai-team/ is runtime state. Three-tier separation is permanent. — decided by Kobayashi
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Per-agent model selection designed — 4-layer priority (user override → charter → registry → auto-select). Role-to-model mapping: Designer→Opus, Tester/Scribe→Haiku, Lead/Dev→Sonnet. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Tiered response modes shipped — Direct/Lightweight/Standard/Full modes replace uniform spawn overhead. Agents may now be spawned with lightweight template (no charter/history/decisions reads) for simple tasks. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Skills Phase 1 + Phase 2 shipped — agents now read SKILL.md files before working and can write SKILL.md files from real work. Skills live in .ai-team/skills/{name}/SKILL.md. Confidence lifecycle: low→medium→high. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Portable Squads consolidated — architecture, platform, and experience merged into single decision — decided by Keaton, Kujan, Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Skills system consolidated — open standard with MCP tool declarations, merging 4 independent analyses — decided by Kujan, Verbal


📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Preview branch added to release pipeline — two-phase workflow: preview then ship. Brady eyeballs preview before anything hits main. — decided by Kobayashi
