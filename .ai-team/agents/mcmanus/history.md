# Project Context

- **Owner:** bradygaster (bradygaster@users.noreply.github.com)
- **Project:** Squad — AI agent teams that grow with your code. Democratizing multi-agent development on GitHub Copilot. Mission: beat the industry to what customers need next.
- **Stack:** Node.js, GitHub Copilot CLI, multi-agent orchestration
- **Created:** 2026-02-07

## Core Context

_Summarized from initial assessment, messaging overhaul, demo script, and README rewrite (2026-02-07). Full entries in `history-archive.md`._

- **DevRel philosophy: first 5 minutes are everything** — README must be magnetic, not just informative. Move users from "what is this?" to "I need this" before the fold.
- **Six onboarding gaps identified**: missing "Why Squad?" value prop, hidden sample-prompts, no troubleshooting, no video/demo, install output lacks explanation, casting treated as Easter egg instead of headline feature.
- **Voice is confident, direct, opinionated** — no hedging ("might," "could be"), no corporate phrases. Show don't abstract ("Keaton decided X" beats "the Lead agent made a decision"). Brand attracts early adopters.
- **Tagline**: "Throw a squad at it" (Brady's cultural hook) — actionable, memorable, opinionated.
- **Casting is a competitive moat** — thematic persistent names make agents memorable and referenceable, unlike generic labels. Elevated from Easter egg to headline feature.
- **Demo script uses beat format** (ON SCREEN / VOICEOVER / WHAT TO DO) — README order is non-negotiable for demos. Payoff at end, not beginning.
- **README rewrite (Proposal 006)**: Hero → Quick Start → Why Squad? → Parallel Work → How It Works → Cast System → What Gets Created → Growing the Team → Reviewer Protocol → Install → Troubleshooting → Status.
